IMPUTATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF ANCESTRAL STATES:
Analysing 281095 sites
Empirical nucleotide frequencies:   A 28.5%   C 22.6%   G 24.5%   T 24.4%
Maximum log-likelihood for imputation and ancestral state reconstruction = -4.949e+06

Beginning branch optimization. Key to parameters (and constraints):
B   uncorrected branch length
L   maximum unnormalized log-posterior per branch
P   contribution of the prior to L
R   R/theta per branch                                       (> 0)
I   mean DNA import length per branch                        (> 0)
D   divergence of DNA imported by recombination              (> 0)
M   expected number of mutations per branch                  (> 0)
